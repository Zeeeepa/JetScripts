Reasoning Chains: A Python Script for Calculating Final Prices

This script implements the Reasoning Chains structure, which is a step-by-step approach to solving problems.
It takes an input, applies the reasoning steps, and produces an output.

Example:
Input: A store offers a 20% discount on a $50 item. What is the final price?
Output: Calculate the discount: 20% of $50 = 0.20 Ã— 50 = $10. Subtract from original price: $50 - $10 = $40. Final price is $40.
