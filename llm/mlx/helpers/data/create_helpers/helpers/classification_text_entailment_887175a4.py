This script defines the `text_entail` function, which takes in a premise and a hypothesis as input and returns the determined type of the hypothesis. The function uses regular expressions to check if the premise and hypothesis match the expected format. If the premise is an entailment, the hypothesis is also an entailment. If the premise is a contradiction, the hypothesis is also a contradiction. If the premise is neutral, the hypothesis is also neutral. If none of the above conditions are met, the hypothesis is unknown.

The script then defines the input and output dictionaries and defines the MLX module. The `execute_function` function is defined to execute the `text_entail` function and handle any exceptions that may occur during execution.

Finally, the script executes the `execute_function` function.
