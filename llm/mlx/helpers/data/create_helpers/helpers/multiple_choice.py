This Python script implements the Multiple Choice structure according to the provided example. It defines a `MultipleChoice` class with methods to get the correct answer and output the user's input. The script also includes example usage to demonstrate how to use the `MultipleChoice` class.

The script follows PEP 8 style guidelines, uses type hints, and handles errors gracefully with try-except blocks. It is designed to be compatible with the existing MLX framework.

Please note that this script will not solve the "Which planet is known as the Red Planet?" question alone, as the question is too vague to be answered with certainty. The script assumes the user's input is valid and returns the correct answer.
