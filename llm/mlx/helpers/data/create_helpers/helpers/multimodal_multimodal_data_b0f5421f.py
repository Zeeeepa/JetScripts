This script implements the Multimodal Data structure as described in the example. It includes the necessary imports, type hints, error handling, and the multimodal data structure itself.

Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

1. **Import necessary modules**: The script starts by importing the necessary modules, including `jet.llm.mlx` which is the jet library for multimodal language models.

2. **Define multimodal data structure**: The script then defines the multimodal data structure itself. This includes the necessary classes, functions, and methods to handle multimodal inputs and outputs.

3. **Implement multimodal data structure**: The script implements the multimodal data structure by providing the necessary functions and classes to handle multimodal inputs and outputs.

4. **Test the multimodal data structure**: The script also includes a test to verify that the multimodal data structure is working correctly.

5. **Document the code**: Finally, the script includes docstrings and comments to document the code and make it easier to understand.

This script provides a complete implementation of the Multimodal Data structure as described in the example. It includes the necessary imports, type hints, error handling, and the multimodal data structure itself.
