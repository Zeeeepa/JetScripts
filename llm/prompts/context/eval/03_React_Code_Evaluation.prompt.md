Given the following React.js code:

```{language}
{code}
```

Evaluate its quality and functionality according to the provided JSON evaluation schema:

```json
{schema}
```

The evaluation result should:

1. Adhere to the schema's structure and validation rules.
2. Be realistic and include detailed feedback for each evaluation dimension (e.g., code quality, functionality, performance, user experience, testing, and meta-information).
3. Include meta-information such as the AI-generated code version, evaluation timestamp, and evaluator credentials.

Output ONLY the JSON evaluation result wrapped in a code block (use ```json).
