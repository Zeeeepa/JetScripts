You are given a user query, some textual context, all inside xml tags. You have to answer the query based on the context

<context>
{context}
</context>

<user_query>
Design a robust JSON schema to contain application database data that can be extracted from context.

This schema should be highly detailed and adaptable for diverse scenarios, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all critical aspects. Specifically, the schema must include fields to capture details across the context.

The schema should support hierarchical nesting, enforce data validation rules, and specify which fields are mandatory or optional.

Ensure the schema is concise, validated, and consistent with modern JSON schema standards. Structure the schema to facilitate easy parsing and future extensibility.

Output ONLY the JSON schema wrapped in a code block (use ```json).
</user_query>
