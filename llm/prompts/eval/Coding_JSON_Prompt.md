Design a standard JSON format to document the evaluation results of code generated by an AI Assistant. The JSON format should include comprehensive fields to capture details about the evaluation process, outcomes, and metadata. Ensure the format is structured, extensible, and adheres to best practices in JSON design. The fields should cover the following aspects:

1. **Code Context and Metadata:**

   - Unique identifier for the evaluation.
   - AI Assistant version and model details.
   - Programming language of the generated code.
   - Date and time of the evaluation.

2. **Evaluation Criteria:**

   - A list of criteria used for evaluation (e.g., functionality, efficiency, readability, maintainability, etc.).
   - Scoring system or metrics applied (e.g., numeric scale, pass/fail, etc.).

3. **Evaluation Results:**

   - Detailed results for each criterion.
   - Overall evaluation status (e.g., success, failure, or percentage score).
   - Issues or bugs identified, if any (with descriptions).

4. **Execution Information:**

   - Input data used for testing.
   - Output produced by the code.
   - Errors encountered during execution (if applicable).

5. **Reviewer Details:**

   - Reviewer identity (if human-reviewed).
   - Review method (automated, manual, or both).

6. **Additional Notes:**
   - Comments, recommendations for improvement, or insights derived from the evaluation.

Provide the JSON schema with examples for clarity, ensuring it is formatted properly and ready for implementation.
