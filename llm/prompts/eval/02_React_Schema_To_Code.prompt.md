Using the provided JSON evaluation schema for assessing AI-generated React.js code, generate an example React.js component that meets the following requirements:

```json
{schema}
```

1. **Functionality**: The component should be a functional React.js component that displays a responsive counter with increment, decrement, and reset buttons.
2. **Best Practices**: Follow React.js best practices, including the use of hooks (e.g., `useState`) and clean, readable code conventions.
3. **Performance**: Ensure efficient re-renders and proper state management.
4. **User Experience**: Include responsive design and basic accessibility features, such as ARIA labels for buttons.
5. **Integration**: Use basic inline styles or CSS modules for styling.

Output only the React.js code without any explanations wrapped in a code block (use ```javascript).
