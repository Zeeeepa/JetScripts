# GraphRAG Implementation with LlamaIndex
#
# [GraphRAG (Graphs + Retrieval Augmented Generation)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/graphrag/) combines the strengths of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) to effectively handle complex queries over large text datasets. While RAG excels in fetching precise information, it struggles with broader queries that require thematic understanding, a challenge that QFS addresses but cannot scale well. GraphRAG integrates these approaches to offer responsive and thorough querying capabilities across extensive, diverse text corpora.
#
#
# This notebook provides guidance on constructing the GraphRAG pipeline using the LlamaIndex PropertyGraph abstractions.
#
#
# **NOTE:** This is an approximate implementation of GraphRAG. We are currently developing a series of cookbooks that will detail the exact implementation of GraphRAG.

# GraphRAG Aproach
#
# The GraphRAG involves two steps:
#
# 1. Graph Generation - Creates Graph, builds communities and its summaries over the given document.
# 2. Answer to the Query - Use summaries of the communities created from step-1 to answer the query.
#
# **Graph Generation:**
#
# 1. **Source Documents to Text Chunks:** Source documents are divided into smaller text chunks for easier processing.
#
# 2. **Text Chunks to Element Instances:** Each text chunk is analyzed to identify and extract entities and relationships, resulting in a list of tuples that represent these elements.
#
# 3. **Element Instances to Element Summaries:** The extracted entities and relationships are summarized into descriptive text blocks for each element using the LLM.
#
# 4. **Element Summaries to Graph Communities:** These entities, relationships and summaries form a graph, which is subsequently partitioned into communities using algorithms using Heirarchical Leiden to establish a hierarchical structure.
#
# 5. **Graph Communities to Community Summaries:** The LLM generates summaries for each community, providing insights into the datasetâ€™s overall topical structure and semantics.
#
# **Answering the Query:**
#
# **Community Summaries to Global Answers:** The summaries of the communities are utilized to respond to user queries. This involves generating intermediate answers, which are then consolidated into a comprehensive global answer.

# GraphRAG Pipeline Components
#
# Here are the different components we implemented to build all of the processes mentioned above.
#
# 1. **Source Documents to Text Chunks:** Implemented using `SentenceSplitter` with a chunk size of 1024 and chunk overlap of 20 tokens.
#
# 2. **Text Chunks to Element Instances AND Element Instances to Element Summaries:** Implemented using `GraphRAGExtractor`.
#
# 3. **Element Summaries to Graph Communities AND Graph Communities to Community Summaries:** Implemented using `GraphRAGStore`.
#
# 4. **Community Summaries to Global Answers:** Implemented using `GraphQueryEngine`.
#
#
# Let's check into each of these components and build GraphRAG pipeline.

# Installation
#
# `graspologic` is used to use hierarchical_leiden for building communities.

# !pip install llama-index graspologic numpy==1.24.4 scipy==1.12.0

# Load Data
#
# We will use a sample news article dataset retrieved from Diffbot, which Tomaz has conveniently made available on GitHub for easy access.
#
# The dataset contains 2,500 samples; for ease of experimentation, we will use 50 of these samples, which include the `title` and `text` of news articles.


news = pd.read_csv(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomasonjo/blog-datasets/main/news_articles.csv"
)[:50]

news.head()

# Prepare documents as required by LlamaIndex

documents = [
    Document(text=f"{row['title']}: {row['text']}")
    for i, row in news.iterrows()
]

# Setup API Key and LLM


# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."


llm = Ollama(model="llama3.1", request_timeout=300.0, context_window=4096)

# GraphRAGExtractor
#
# The GraphRAGExtractor class is designed to extract triples (subject-relation-object) from text and enrich them by adding descriptions for entities and relationships to their properties using an LLM.
#
# This functionality is similar to that of the `SimpleLLMPathExtractor`, but includes additional enhancements to handle entity, relationship descriptions. For guidance on implementation, you may look at similar existing [extractors](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/property_graph/Dynamic_KG_Extraction/?h=comparing).
#
# Here's a breakdown of its functionality:
#
# **Key Components:**
#
# 1. `llm:` The language model used for extraction.
# 2. `extract_prompt:` A prompt template used to guide the LLM in extracting information.
# 3. `parse_fn:` A function to parse the LLM's output into structured data.
# 4. `max_paths_per_chunk:` Limits the number of triples extracted per text chunk.
# 5. `num_workers:` For parallel processing of multiple text nodes.
#
#
# **Main Methods:**
#
# 1. `__call__:` The entry point for processing a list of text nodes.
# 2. `acall:` An asynchronous version of __call__ for improved performance.
# 3. `_aextract:` The core method that processes each individual node.
#
#
# **Extraction Process:**
#
# For each input node (chunk of text):
# 1. It sends the text to the LLM along with the extraction prompt.
# 2. The LLM's response is parsed to extract entities, relationships, descriptions for entities and relations.
# 3. Entities are converted into EntityNode objects. Entity description is stored in metadata
# 4. Relationships are converted into Relation objects. Relationship description is stored in metadata.
# 5. These are added to the node's metadata under KG_NODES_KEY and KG_RELATIONS_KEY.
#
# **NOTE:** In the current implementation, we are using only relationship descriptions. In the next implementation, we will utilize entity descriptions during the retrieval stage.

# Future Work:
#
# This cookbook is an approximate implementation of GraphRAG. In future cookbooks, we plan to extend it as follows:
#
# 1. Implement retrieval using entity description embeddings.
# 2. Integrate with Neo4JPropertyGraphStore.
# 3. Calculate a helpfulness score for each answer generated from the community summaries and filter out answers where the helpfulness score is zero.
# 4. Perform entity disambiguation to remove duplicate entities.
# 5. Implement claims or covariate information extraction, Local Search and Global Search techniques.
