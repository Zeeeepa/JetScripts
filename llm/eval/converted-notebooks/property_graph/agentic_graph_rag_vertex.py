# Agentic GraphRAG Implementation with LlamaIndex and Vertex AI
#
#
#

# ------------
# **Pre-requisites**
# - Set up a Google Cloud project
# - Create a Google Cloud storage bucket
# - Enable Vertex AI API
#
#
# References:
# This notebook is based on below references.
#
# 1. GraphRAG Implementation with LlamaIndex
# - https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/docs/docs/examples/cookbooks/GraphRAG_v1.ipynb

# 2. Building Agentic RAG with Llamaindex Tutorial
# - https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/building-agentic-rag-with-llamaindex/lesson/2/router-query-engine

# _______________

# GraphRAG Aproach
#
# The GraphRAG involves two steps:
#
# 1. Graph Generation - Creates Graph, builds communities and its summaries over the given document.
# 2. Answer to the Query - Use summaries of the communities created from step-1 to answer the query.
#
# **Graph Generation:**
#
# 1. **Source Documents to Text Chunks:** Source documents are divided into smaller text chunks for easier processing.
#
# 2. **Text Chunks to Element Instances:** Each text chunk is analyzed to identify and extract entities and relationships, resulting in a list of tuples that represent these elements.
#
# 3. **Element Instances to Element Summaries:** The extracted entities and relationships are summarized into descriptive text blocks for each element using the LLM.
#
# 4. **Element Summaries to Graph Communities:** These entities, relationships and summaries form a graph, which is subsequently partitioned into communities using algorithms using Heirarchical Leiden to establish a hierarchical structure.
#
# 5. **Graph Communities to Community Summaries:** The LLM generates summaries for each community, providing insights into the datasetâ€™s overall topical structure and semantics.
#
# **Answering the Query:**
#
# **Community Summaries to Global Answers:** The summaries of the communities are utilized to respond to user queries. This involves generating intermediate answers, which are then consolidated into a comprehensive global answer.

# GraphRAG Pipeline Components
#
# Here are the different components we implemented to build all of the processes mentioned above.
#
# 1. **Source Documents to Text Chunks:** Implemented using `SentenceSplitter` with a chunk size of 1024 and chunk overlap of 20 tokens.
#
# 2. **Text Chunks to Element Instances AND Element Instances to Element Summaries:** Implemented using `GraphRAGExtractor`.
#
# 3. **Element Summaries to Graph Communities AND Graph Communities to Community Summaries:** Implemented using `GraphRAGStore`.
#
# 4. **Community Summaries to Global Answers:** Implemented using `GraphQueryEngine`.
#
#
# Let's check into each of these components and build GraphRAG pipeline.

# Installation
#
# `graspologic` is used to use hierarchical_leiden for building communities.

# !pip install llama-index graspologic numpy==1.24.4 scipy==1.12.0

# !pip install --upgrade google-cloud-aiplatform llama-index-vector-stores-vertexaivectorsearch llama-index llama_index-llms-vertex

# GraphRAGExtractor
#
# The GraphRAGExtractor class is designed to extract triples (subject-relation-object) from text and enrich them by adding descriptions for entities and relationships to their properties using an LLM.
#
# This functionality is similar to that of the `SimpleLLMPathExtractor`, but includes additional enhancements to handle entity, relationship descriptions. For guidance on implementation, you may look at similar existing [extractors](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/property_graph/Dynamic_KG_Extraction/?h=comparing).
#
# Here's a breakdown of its functionality:
#
# **Key Components:**
#
# 1. `llm:` The language model used for extraction.
# 2. `extract_prompt:` A prompt template used to guide the LLM in extracting information.
# 3. `parse_fn:` A function to parse the LLM's output into structured data.
# 4. `max_paths_per_chunk:` Limits the number of triples extracted per text chunk.
# 5. `num_workers:` For parallel processing of multiple text nodes.
#
#
# **Main Methods:**
#
# 1. `__call__:` The entry point for processing a list of text nodes.
# 2. `acall:` An asynchronous version of __call__ for improved performance.
# 3. `_aextract:` The core method that processes each individual node.
#
#
# **Extraction Process:**
#
# For each input node (chunk of text):
# 1. It sends the text to the LLM along with the extraction prompt.
# 2. The LLM's response is parsed to extract entities, relationships, descriptions for entities and relations.
# 3. Entities are converted into EntityNode objects. Entity description is stored in metadata
# 4. Relationships are converted into Relation objects. Relationship description is stored in metadata.
# 5. These are added to the node's metadata under KG_NODES_KEY and KG_RELATIONS_KEY.
#
# **NOTE:** In the current implementation, we are using only relationship descriptions. In the next implementation, we will utilize entity descriptions during the retrieval stage.

#
# `graph_store:` An instance of GraphRAGStore, which contains the community summaries.
# `llm:` A Language Model (LLM) used for generating and aggregating answers.
#
#
# **Key Methods:**
#
# `custom_query(query_str: str)`
#
# 1. This is the main entry point for processing a query. It retrieves community summaries, generates answers from each summary, and then aggregates these answers into a final response.
#
# `generate_answer_from_summary(community_summary, query):`
#
# 1. Generates an answer for the query based on a single community summary.
# Uses the LLM to interpret the community summary in the context of the query.
#
# `aggregate_answers(community_answers):`
#
# 1. Combines individual answers from different communities into a coherent final response.
# 2. Uses the LLM to synthesize multiple perspectives into a single, concise answer.
#
#
# **Query Processing Flow:**
#
# 1. Retrieve community summaries from the graph store.
# 2. For each community summary, generate a specific answer to the query.
# 3. Aggregate all community-specific answers into a final, coherent response.

# Build End to End GraphRAG Pipeline

# 1. Create nodes/chunks from the text.
# 2. Build a PropertyGraphIndex using `GraphRAGExtractor` and `GraphRAGStore`.
# 3. Construct communities and generate a summary for each community using the graph built above.
# 4. Create a `GraphRAGQueryEngine` and begin querying.

-Goal-
Given a text document, identify all entities and their entity types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
Given the text, extract up to {max_knowledge_triplets} entity-relation triplets.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Type of the entity
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"$$$$<entity_name>$$$$<entity_type>$$$$<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relation: relationship between source_entity and target_entity
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other

Format each relationship as ("relationship"$$$$<source_entity>$$$$<target_entity>$$$$<relation>$$$$<relationship_description>)

3. When finished, output.
