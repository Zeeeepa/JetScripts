# Refine with Structured Answer Filtering
When using our Refine response synthesizer for response synthesis, it's crucial to filter out non-answers. An issue often encountered is the propagation of a single unhelpful response like "I don't have the answer", which can persist throughout the synthesis process and lead to a final answer of the same nature. This can occur even when there are actual answers present in other, more relevant sections.

These unhelpful responses can be filtered out by setting `structured_answer_filtering` to `True`. It is set to `False` by default since this currently only works best if you are using an Ollama model that supports function calling.

## Non Function-calling LLMs
You may want to make use of this filtering functionality with an LLM that doesn't offer a function calling API.

In that case, the `Refine` module will automatically switch to using a structured output `Program` that doesn't rely on an external function calling API.
