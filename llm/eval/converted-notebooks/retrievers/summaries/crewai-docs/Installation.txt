To get started with CrewAI, you need to install it. The installation process involves two methods: installing CrewAI with all recommended tools using either `pip install 'crewai[tools]'` or `pip install crewai crewai-tools`. If you have an older version of CrewAI installed, you can upgrade it by running `pip install --upgrade crewai crewai-tools`. After the installation is complete, verify that it was successful by checking your installed versions using `pip freeze | grep crewai`.
