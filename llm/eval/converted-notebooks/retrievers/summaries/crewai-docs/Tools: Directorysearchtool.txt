The DirectorySearchTool is a powerful tool designed for semantic searches within a directory's content. It leverages the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methodology for efficient navigation through files and allows users to dynamically specify search directories at runtime or set a fixed directory during initial setup. The tool can be customized with various settings, including changing the model provider and configuration for OpenAI embeddings and summarization.
