This guide provides a step-by-step process for replaying tasks from the latest crew kickoff in CrewAI. It explains how to use the CLI and programmatically replay specific tasks, including how to view the latest kickoff task IDs and execute the replay command within a try-except block to handle potential errors. The feature is useful for retrying certain tasks or not refetching data when agents already have context saved from the kickoff execution.
