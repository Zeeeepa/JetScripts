CrewAI utilizes anonymous telemetry to gather usage statistics for enhancing the library. By default, no personal data is collected, but users can opt-in to share detailed crew and task execution data by enabling the `share_crew` feature. This expanded data collection may include personal information if users have incorporated it into their crews or tasks. The primary goal of telemetry is to improve and develop features, integrations, and tools most utilized by users.
