The WebsiteSearchTool is an experimental tool designed to perform semantic searches within website content. It leverages advanced machine learning models like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to efficiently navigate and extract information from specified URLs, offering flexibility for searching across any website or focusing on specific websites of interest. The tool's current implementation details are under development, but it aims to provide a user-friendly interface for conducting targeted searches.
