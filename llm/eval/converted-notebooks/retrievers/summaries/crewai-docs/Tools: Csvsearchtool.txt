A powerful tool designed for semantic searches within a CSV file's content. It allows users to semantically search for queries in the content of a specified CSV file, making it particularly useful for extracting information from large CSV datasets where traditional search methods might be inefficient. The tool is experimental and may have unexpected behavior or changes in the future.
