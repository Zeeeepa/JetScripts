A comprehensive guide to utilizing sequential processes for task execution in CrewAI projects. It outlines how to effectively implement these processes to ensure efficient task execution and project completion. The guide covers key features such as linear task flow, simplicity, and easy monitoring, as well as implementing the sequential process by assembling a crew and defining tasks in order. It also touches on advanced features like task delegation, asynchronous execution, memory and caching, callbacks, and usage metrics. Additionally, it provides best practices for using sequential processes, including ordering tasks logically, providing clear task descriptions, selecting appropriate agents, and leveraging context from previous tasks.
