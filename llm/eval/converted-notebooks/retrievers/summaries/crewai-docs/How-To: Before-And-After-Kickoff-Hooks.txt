This guide provides an overview of how to use before and after kickoff hooks in CrewAI. It explains that these hooks allow you to execute code at specific points during a crew's execution, enabling preprocessing inputs or post-processing results. The guide also includes examples of defining before and after kickoff functions, demonstrating how to modify inputs and process results. Overall, it highlights the benefits of using these hooks for maintaining clean code architecture and enhancing modularity in CrewAI implementations.
