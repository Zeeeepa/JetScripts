To monitor your Agents in just a single line of code with OpenTelemetry, follow these steps:

1. Deploy OpenLIT by cloning its repository and running Docker Compose.
2. Install the OpenLIT SDK using pip.
3. Initialize OpenLIT in your application by adding two lines of code.

Once set up, you can visualize and analyze your Agent's performance, behavior, and identify areas of improvement by accessing OpenLIT at `127.0.0.1:3000` on your browser.
