This tool is designed to perform semantic searches within YouTube video content using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. It allows for flexibility in searches, enabling users to search across any YouTube video content without specifying a URL or target their search to a specific video by providing its URL. The tool can be integrated into Python projects and accepts optional initialization arguments, including the ability to customize models and embeddings using a config dictionary.
