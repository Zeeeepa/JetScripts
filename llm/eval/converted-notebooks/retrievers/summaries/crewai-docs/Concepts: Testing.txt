Testing is a crucial part of the development process that ensures your crew is performing as expected. It involves running your crew for a specified number of iterations to provide detailed performance metrics. The built-in testing capabilities make it easy to test and evaluate your crew's performance using CLI commands like `crewai test`. This command allows you to specify parameters such as the number of iterations and the model used, providing a comprehensive understanding of your crew's strengths and weaknesses.
