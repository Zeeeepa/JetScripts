The CodeDocsSearchTool is a powerful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) tool designed for semantic searches within code documentation. It enables users to efficiently find specific information or topics within code documentation, and can be customized with various models and embeddings. The tool can search across a wide array of code documentation known or discovered throughout its execution, or focus on a specific documentation site by providing its URL.
