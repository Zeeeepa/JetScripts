To force tool output as the result in an Agent's task, you need to set a specific parameter to True when adding a tool. This ensures that the tool output is captured and returned without any modifications by the agent. The process involves executing the task using the provided tool, capturing its output, allowing the agent to reflect but not modifying it, and finally returning the tool output as the task result.
