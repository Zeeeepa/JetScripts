To get started with using AgentOps for observability, you'll need to create an API key on the AgentOps account page. Once you have your API key, add it to your environment variables and install AgentOps using pip. Before running your Crew script, initialize AgentOps by importing the agentops module and calling init(). This will initiate an AgentOps session and track your Crew agents.
