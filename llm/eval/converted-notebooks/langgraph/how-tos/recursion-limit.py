You can set the graph recursion limit when invoking or streaming the graph. The recursion limit sets the number of **supersteps** that the graph is allowed to execute before it raises an error. Read more about the concept of recursion limits [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#recursion-limit). Let's see an example of this in a simple graph with parallel branches to better understand exactly how the recursion limit works.

If you want to see an example of how you can return the last value of your state instead of receiving a recursion limit error form your graph, read [this how-to](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/return-when-recursion-limit-hits/).

As we can see, our graph will execute nodes `b` and `c` in parallel (i.e. in a single super-step), which means that if we run this graph it should take exactly 3 steps. We can set the recursion limit to 3 first to check that it raises an error (the recursion limit is inclusive, so if the limit is 3 the graph will raise an error when it reaches step 3) as expected:

Success! The graph raised an error as expected - now let's test setting the recursion limit to 4 and ensure that the graph succeeds in this case:

try:

Perfect, just as we expected the graph runs successfully in this case. 

Setting the correct graph recursion limit is important for avoiding graph runs stuck in long-running loops and thus helps minimize unnecessary costs
