`SentenceTransformer` provides several types of functions with real-world applications. Some of the most common types include:

### 1. **Embedding Generation (Sentence Embeddings)**
   - **Function:** Converts text into fixed-length vector representations.
   - **Real-world Use Case:** 
     - **Search & Information Retrieval:** Converting a query and documents into embeddings to perform semantic search.
     - **Example:** A legal research platform could use `SentenceTransformer` to create embeddings of case law and retrieve the most relevant ones based on a user’s query.

   ```python
   from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
   model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
   embeddings = model.encode(["This is a sentence.", "This is another sentence."])
   ```

### 2. **Semantic Textual Similarity (STS)**
   - **Function:** Measures how similar two pieces of text are by calculating the cosine similarity between their embeddings.
   - **Real-world Use Case:**
     - **Plagiarism Detection:** Detecting similarity between academic papers to identify potential plagiarism.
     - **Example:** An anti-plagiarism tool checks the similarity between student submissions and a database of existing papers.

   ```python
   cosine_similarity = np.dot(embeddings[0], embeddings[1]) / (np.linalg.norm(embeddings[0]) * np.linalg.norm(embeddings[1]))
   ```

### 3. **Text Classification (Using Sentence-Pair Models)**
   - **Function:** Classifies text into predefined categories based on sentence pairs.
   - **Real-world Use Case:**
     - **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining whether customer reviews are positive, negative, or neutral.
     - **Example:** A company uses `SentenceTransformer` to classify customer feedback into various sentiment categories.

   ```python
   model = SentenceTransformer('distilbert-base-nli-stsb-mean-tokens')
   sentences = ["I love this product!", "I hate the customer service."]
   labels = model.predict(sentences)
   ```

### 4. **Question Answering (QA)**
   - **Function:** Uses embeddings to find answers to specific questions from a given context.
   - **Real-world Use Case:**
     - **Customer Support:** An AI-based FAQ system can find the answer to user queries based on embeddings of the question and the FAQ content.
     - **Example:** A bank’s chatbot can retrieve specific answers from a knowledge base by matching customer questions to answers in the FAQ.

   ```python
   context = "The bank is open from 9 AM to 5 PM."
   question = "What time does the bank open?"
   answer = model.answer_question(context, question)
   ```

### 5. **Text Clustering**
   - **Function:** Groups similar texts together by encoding them into embeddings and then applying clustering techniques.
   - **Real-world Use Case:**
     - **Topic Modeling:** Clustering articles or documents into topics, such as news articles into categories like sports, politics, and technology.
     - **Example:** A news aggregator service groups articles by topic using clustering.

   ```python
   from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
   model = SentenceTransformer('paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2')
   embeddings = model.encode(["Article 1 text", "Article 2 text", "Article 3 text"])
   kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
   kmeans.fit(embeddings)
   ```

### 6. **Sentence Pair Classification (Cross-Encoder)**
   - **Function:** Evaluates the relationship between two sentences (e.g., similarity, entailment).
   - **Real-world Use Case:**
     - **Duplicate Question Detection:** In customer support or QA systems, detecting if a question has already been asked.
     - **Example:** A support bot checks if a new customer query is similar to any previously asked questions to avoid repetitive responses.

   ```python
   from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder
   model = CrossEncoder('distilbert-base-nli-mean-tokens')
   score = model.predict([["Is it raining?", "Will it rain today?"]])
   ```

### 7. **Re-ranking (Ranking Candidate Sentences)**
   - **Function:** Ranks a set of candidate sentences based on their relevance to a given query or context. This is often used after an initial retrieval step to refine the ranking of the results.
   - **Real-world Use Case:**
     - **Search Engine Results Optimization:** After retrieving a list of documents or answers, a re-ranking model improves the order by using deeper context from both the query and candidate.
     - **Example:** In an e-commerce site, after retrieving product recommendations, a re-ranking model orders the results by relevance to the user's preferences or recent activity.

   ```python
   from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder
   model = CrossEncoder('ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v3')
   queries = ["Best laptops under $1000"]
   candidate_docs = ["Laptop A features", "Laptop B specs", "Laptop C review"]
   ranked_docs = model.predict([(query, doc) for query in queries for doc in candidate_docs])
   ```

Each function serves different needs, making `SentenceTransformer` highly versatile for various NLP tasks.
