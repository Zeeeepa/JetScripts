    # E2E Testing Agent
    
    ## Overview
    This notebook defines an intelligent agent designed to control a headless browser and perform end-to-end (E2E) testing on web pages. 
    Users can specify the webpage URL and describe test cases in natural language. 
    The agent will interpret these instructions, generate, and execute the tests.
    
    ## Motivation
    Programmatic browser control and E2E testing were traditionally done by writing scripts in frameworks such as Puppeteer or Playwright. We want to use the Agent system to allow the user to specify the E2E test cases in natural language. The agent will then create and execute these tests through Playwright.
    
    ## Key Components
    1. [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) - agent implementation
    2. [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python) - a Python Playwright version that we can use to generate a script that can execute the test
    3. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) - A web framework that servers static HTML web page with a registration form
    4. [langchain_community.agent_toolkits.PlayWrightBrowserToolkit](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/integrations/toolkits/playwright/)
    
    ## Method
    The E2E tests generation process goes through the following steps:
    
    1. **Instructions To Actions Conversion**: Convert user instruction for testing into well defined action steps that will be implemented.
    
    2. **Playwright Code Generation**: Generate Playwright code chunks that execute specified action steps.
    
    3. **Assertions Generation**: Creates assertions that specify whether the test have passed or not.
    
    4. **Test Execution**: Evaluates the generate Playwright test case.
    
    5. **Report Generation**: Creates the concise report of 
    
    
    ## Conclusion
    The implemented agent generates and evaluates Playwright tests based on user instructions, dynamically adapting to changes in the webpage DOM. It executes the tests and provides a concise report. Making the E2E testing process more accessible.
