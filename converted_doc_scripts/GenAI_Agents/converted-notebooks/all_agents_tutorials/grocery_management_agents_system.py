# üõí Grocery Management Agents System

This tutorial will guide you through using CrewAI agents to automate grocery management. We'll cover how to extract grocery data from receipts, estimate expiration dates, track grocery inventory, and recommend recipes using leftover items.

## üåê 2. Environment Setup <a id="environment-setup"></a>

### Step 1: Install Required Packages
Make sure you have the necessary packages installed:
"""
logger.info("# üõí Grocery Management Agents System")

# !pip install Markdown==3.7
# !pip install crewai==0.80.0
# !pip install crewai_tools

"""
### Step 2: Set Up Your API Key
You will need an MLX API key to proceed. Please store it securely and load it into your environment.

Additionally, if you wish to test the functionality that reads real receipts and converts them into markdown files, you'll need a LLAMA OCR API key. This is optional but recommended for testing with actual receipt images. You can obtain a LLAMA OCR API key from [here](https://api.together.ai/).

Note: Sample receipts have already been processed and saved in the file located at:
`data/grocery_management_agents_system/extracted/grocery_receipt.md`.
"""
logger.info("### Step 2: Set Up Your API Key")


# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "[YOUR OPENAI API KEY]"

os.environ["LLAMA_OCR_API_KEY"] = "[YOUR LLAMA OCR API KEY]"

"""
### Step 3: Extract Receipt Information from a Receipt Image (Optional)

By default, the test extracted information has already been saved in:  
`GenAI_Agents/data/grocery_management_agents_system/extracted/grocery_receipt.md`.

However, if you'd like to test using different receipt images, you can do so by following these steps:

1. **Add Your Receipt Image**  
   Place your image in the following folder:  
   `GenAI_Agents/data/grocery_management_agents_system/input`

2. **Update the Script**  
   Open the `extract_items.js` file and change the `filePath` variable to the name of your new image.

3. **Run the Script**  
   In your terminal, navigate to the input directory and run the script:

   ```bash
   cd GenAI_Agents/data/grocery_management_agents_system/input
   node extract_items.js
The newly generated markdown file will be saved in:
`GenAI_Agents/data/grocery_management_agents_system/extracted/`

**How to Use Node.js**

To get started with Node.js, you'll first need to install **NVM (Node Version Manager)**. This allows you to easily manage different versions of Node.js on your system.

For macOS users, you can find a detailed guide on installing NVM [here](https://medium.com/@andrewjaykeller/how-to-install-node-js-and-npm-with-macoss-new-terminal-zsh-e39b4a62d3d4).
