    ## Retriever Example
    
    This notebook demonstrates how to search historical chat message histories using the [Zep Long-term Memory Store](https://getzep.github.io/).
    
    We'll demonstrate:
    
    1. Adding conversation history to the Zep memory store.
    2. Vector search over the conversation history: 
        1. With a similarity search over chat messages
        2. Using maximal marginal relevance re-ranking of a chat message search
        3. Filtering a search using metadata filters
        4. A similarity search over summaries of the chat messages
        5. Using maximal marginal relevance re-ranking of a summary search
