# Google Memorystore for Redis

> [Google Memorystore for Redis](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/memorystore-for-redis-overview) is a fully-managed service that is powered by the Redis in-memory data store to build application caches that provide sub-millisecond data access. Extend your database application to build AI-powered experiences leveraging Memorystore for Redis's Langchain integrations.

This notebook goes over how to use [Memorystore for Redis](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/memorystore-for-redis-overview) to store vector embeddings with the `MemorystoreVectorStore` class.

Learn more about the package on [GitHub](https://github.com/googleapis/langchain-google-memorystore-redis-python/).

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googleapis/langchain-google-memorystore-redis-python/blob/main/docs/vector_store.ipynb)

## Pre-reqs

## Before You Begin

To run this notebook, you will need to do the following:

* [Create a Google Cloud Project](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project)
* [Enable the Memorystore for Redis API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=redis.googleapis.com)
* [Create a Memorystore for Redis instance](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/create-instance-console). Ensure that the version is greater than or equal to 7.2.

### ü¶úüîó Library Installation

The integration lives in its own `langchain-google-memorystore-redis` package, so we need to install it.
"""
logger.info("# Google Memorystore for Redis")

# %pip install -upgrade --quiet langchain-google-memorystore-redis langchain

"""
**Colab only:** Uncomment the following cell to restart the kernel or use the button to restart the kernel. For Vertex AI Workbench you can restart the terminal using the button on top.

## Basic Usage

### Initialize a Vector Index
"""
logger.info("## Basic Usage")


redis_client = redis.from_url("redis://127.0.0.1:6379")

index_config = HNSWConfig(
    name="my_vector_index", distance_strategy=DistanceStrategy.COSINE, vector_size=128
)

RedisVectorStore.init_index(client=redis_client, index_config=index_config)

"""
### Prepare Documents

Text needs processing and numerical representation before interacting with a vector store. This involves:

* Loading Text: The TextLoader obtains text data from a file (e.g., "state_of_the_union.txt").
* Text Splitting: The CharacterTextSplitter breaks the text into smaller chunks for embedding models.
"""
logger.info("### Prepare Documents")


loader = TextLoader("./state_of_the_union.txt")
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

"""
### Add Documents to the Vector Store

After text preparation and embedding generation, the following methods insert them into the Redis vector store.

#### Method 1: Classmethod for Direct Insertion

This approach combines embedding creation and insertion into a single step using the from_documents classmethod:
"""
logger.info("### Add Documents to the Vector Store")


embeddings = FakeEmbeddings(size=128)
redis_client = redis.from_url("redis://127.0.0.1:6379")
rvs = RedisVectorStore.from_documents(
    docs, embedding=embeddings, client=redis_client, index_name="my_vector_index"
)

"""
#### Method 2: Instance-Based Insertion
This approach offers flexibility when working with a new or existing RedisVectorStore:

* [Optional] Create a RedisVectorStore Instance: Instantiate a RedisVectorStore object for customization. If you already have an instance, proceed to the next step.
* Add Text with Metadata: Provide raw text and metadata to the instance. Embedding generation and insertion into the vector store are handled automatically.
"""
logger.info("#### Method 2: Instance-Based Insertion")

rvs = RedisVectorStore(
    client=redis_client, index_name="my_vector_index", embeddings=embeddings
)
ids = rvs.add_texts(
    texts=[d.page_content for d in docs], metadatas=[d.metadata for d in docs]
)

"""
### Perform a Similarity Search (KNN)

With the vector store populated, it's possible to search for text semantically similar to a query.  Here's how to use KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) with default settings:

* Formulate the Query: A natural language question expresses the search intent (e.g., "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson").
* Retrieve Similar Results: The `similarity_search` method finds items in the vector store closest to the query in meaning.
"""
logger.info("### Perform a Similarity Search (KNN)")


query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
knn_results = rvs.similarity_search(query=query)
pprint.plogger.debug(knn_results)

"""
### Perform a Range-Based Similarity Search

Range queries provide more control by specifying a desired similarity threshold along with the query text:

* Formulate the Query: A natural language question defines the search intent.
* Set Similarity Threshold: The distance_threshold parameter determines how close a match must be considered relevant.
* Retrieve Results: The `similarity_search_with_score` method finds items from the vector store that fall within the specified similarity threshold.
"""
logger.info("### Perform a Range-Based Similarity Search")

rq_results = rvs.similarity_search_with_score(query=query, distance_threshold=0.8)
pprint.plogger.debug(rq_results)

"""
### Perform a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) Search

MMR queries aim to find results that are both relevant to the query and diverse from each other, reducing redundancy in search results.

* Formulate the Query: A natural language question defines the search intent.
* Balance Relevance and Diversity: The lambda_mult parameter controls the trade-off between strict relevance and promoting variety in the results.
* Retrieve MMR Results: The `max_marginal_relevance_search` method returns items that optimize the combination of relevance and diversity based on the lambda setting.
"""
logger.info("### Perform a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) Search")

mmr_results = rvs.max_marginal_relevance_search(query=query, lambda_mult=0.90)
pprint.plogger.debug(mmr_results)

"""
## Use the Vector Store as a Retriever

For seamless integration with other LangChain components, a vector store can be converted into a Retriever. This offers several advantages:

* LangChain Compatibility: Many LangChain tools and methods are designed to directly interact with retrievers.
* Ease of Use: The `as_retriever()` method converts the vector store into a format that simplifies querying.
"""
logger.info("## Use the Vector Store as a Retriever")

retriever = rvs.as_retriever()
results = retriever.invoke(query)
pprint.plogger.debug(results)

"""
## Clean up

### Delete Documents from the Vector Store

Occasionally, it's necessary to remove documents (and their associated vectors) from the vector store.  The `delete` method provides this functionality.
"""
logger.info("## Clean up")

rvs.delete(ids)

"""
### Delete a Vector Index

There might be circumstances where the deletion of an existing vector index is necessary. Common reasons include:

* Index Configuration Changes: If index parameters need modification, it's often required to delete and recreate the index.
* Storage Management: Removing unused indices can help free up space within the Redis instance.

Caution: Vector index deletion is an irreversible operation. Be certain that the stored vectors and search functionality are no longer required before proceeding.
