# Pinecone (sparse)

>[Pinecone](https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/overview) is a vector database with broad functionality.

This notebook shows how to use functionality related to the `Pinecone` vector database.

## Setup

To use the `PineconeSparseVectorStore` you first need to install the partner package, as well as the other packages used throughout this notebook.

## Query vector store

Once we have loaded our documents into the vector store we're most likely ready to begin querying. There are various method for doing this in LangChain.

We can also add [metadata filtering](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/data/understanding-metadata#metadata-query-language) to our query to limit our search based on various criteria. Let's try a simple filter to limit our search to include only records with `source=="social"`:

### As a Retriever
