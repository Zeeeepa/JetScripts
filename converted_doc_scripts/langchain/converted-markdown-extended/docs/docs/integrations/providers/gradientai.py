This will help you getting started with DigitalOcean Gradient [chat models](/docs/concepts/chat_models).


## Setup

langchain-gradient uses DigitalOcean's Gradientâ„¢ AI Platform.

Create an account on DigitalOcean, acquire a `DIGITALOCEAN_INFERENCE_KEY` API key from the Gradient Platform, and install the `langchain-gradient` integration package.

### Credentials

Head to [DigitalOcean Gradient](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/gradient)

1. Sign up/Login to DigitalOcean Cloud Console
2. Go to the Gradient Platform and navigate to Serverless Inference.
3. Click on Create model access key, enter a name, and create the key.

Once you've done this set the `DIGITALOCEAN_INFERENCE_KEY` environment variable:
"""
logger.info("# DigitalOcean Gradient")

os.environ["DIGITALOCEAN_INFERENCE_KEY"] = "your-api-key"

"""
### Installation

The LangChain Gradient integration is in the `langchain-gradient` package:
"""
logger.info("### Installation")

pip install -qU langchain-gradient

"""
## Instantiation
