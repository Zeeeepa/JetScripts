# Embedding Similarity Evaluator

This notebook shows the `SemanticSimilarityEvaluator`, which evaluates the quality of a question answering system via semantic similarity.

Concretely, it calculates the similarity score between embeddings of the generated answer and the reference answer.

If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.

During the day, when the sun is in the sky, the sky often appears blue.
This is because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, where molecules and particles in the Earth's atmosphere scatter sunlight in all directions, and blue light is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves.
This is why we perceive the sky as blue on a clear day.
