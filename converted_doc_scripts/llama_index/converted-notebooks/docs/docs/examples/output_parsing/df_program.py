# DataFrame Structured Data Extraction

This demo shows how you can extract tabular DataFrames from raw text.

This was directly inspired by jxnl's dataframe example here: https://github.com/jxnl/openai_function_call/blob/main/auto_dataframe.py.

We show this with different levels of complexity, all backed by the OllamaFunctionCallingAdapter Function API:
- (more code) How to build an extractor yourself using our OllamaFunctionCallingAdapterPydanticProgram
- (less code) Using our out-of-the-box `DFFullProgram` and `DFRowsProgram` objects

## Build a DF Extractor Yourself (Using OllamaFunctionCallingAdapterPydanticProgram)

Our OllamaFunctionCallingAdapterPydanticProgram is a wrapper around an OllamaFunctionCallingAdapter LLM that supports function calling - it will return structured
outputs in the form of a Pydantic object.

We import our `DataFrame` and `DataFrameRowsOnly` objects.

To create an output extractor, you just need to 1) specify the relevant Pydantic object, and 2) Add the right prompt

If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ü¶ô.
