# Cookbook LlamaIndex Integration (Instrumentation Module)

This is a simple cookbook that demonstrates how to use the [LlamaIndex Langfuse integration](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/llama-index/get-started) using the [instrumentation module](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/observability/instrumentation/) by LlamaIndex (available in llama-index v0.10.20 and later).

Maxwell "Max" Silverstein, a lauded movie director, screenwriter, and producer, was born on October 25, 1978, in Boston, Massachusetts. A film enthusiast from a young age, his journey began with home movies shot on a Super 8 camera. His passion led him to the University of Southern California (USC), majoring in Film Production. Eventually, he started his career as an assistant director at Paramount Pictures. Silverstein's directorial debut, ‚ÄúDoors Unseen,‚Äù a psychological thriller, earned him recognition at the Sundance Film Festival and marked the beginning of a successful directing career.

Throughout his career, Silverstein has been celebrated for his diverse range of filmography and unique narrative technique. He masterfully blends suspense, human emotion, and subtle humor in his storylines. Among his notable works are "Fleeting Echoes," "Halcyon Dusk," and the Academy Award-winning sci-fi epic, "Event Horizon's Brink." His contribution to cinema revolves around examining human nature, the complexity of relationships, and probing reality and perception. Off-camera, he is a dedicated philanthropist living in Los Angeles with his wife and two children.
