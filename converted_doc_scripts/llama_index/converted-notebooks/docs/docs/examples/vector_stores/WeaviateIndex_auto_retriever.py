# Auto-Retrieval from a Weaviate Vector Database

This guide shows how to perform **auto-retrieval** in LlamaIndex with [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/). 

The Weaviate vector database supports a set of [metadata filters](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/search/filters) in addition to a query string for semantic search. Given a natural language query, we first use a Large Language Model (LLM) to infer a set of metadata filters as well as the right query string to pass to the vector database (either can also be blank). This overall query bundle is then executed against the vector database.

This allows for more dynamic, expressive forms of retrieval beyond top-k semantic search. The relevant context for a given query may only require filtering on a metadata tag, or require a joint combination of filtering + semantic search within the filtered set, or just raw semantic search.

## Setup 

We first define imports and define an empty Weaviate collection.

If you're opening this Notebook on Colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.
