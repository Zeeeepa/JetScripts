# Refine with Structured Answer Filtering
When using our Refine response synthesizer for response synthesis, it's crucial to filter out non-answers. An issue often encountered is the propagation of a single unhelpful response like "I don't have the answer", which can persist throughout the synthesis process and lead to a final answer of the same nature. This can occur even when there are actual answers present in other, more relevant sections.

These unhelpful responses can be filtered out by setting `structured_answer_filtering` to `True`. It is set to `False` by default since this currently only works best if you are using an OllamaFunctionCallingAdapter model that supports function calling.

If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.
