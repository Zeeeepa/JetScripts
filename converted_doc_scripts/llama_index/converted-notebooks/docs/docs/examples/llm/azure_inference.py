## Prerequisites

The Azure AI model inference is an API that allows developers to get access to a variety of models hosted on Azure AI using a consistent schema. You can use `llama-index-llms-azure-inference` integration package with models that support this API, including models deployed to Azure AI serverless API endpoints and a subset of models from Managed Inference. To read more about the API specification and the models that support it see [Azure AI model inference API](https://aka.ms/azureai/modelinference).

To run this tutorial you need:

1. Create an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com).
2. Create an Azure AI hub resource as explained at [How to create and manage an Azure AI Studio hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/create-azure-ai-resource).
3. Deploy one model supporting the [Azure AI model inference API](https://aka.ms/azureai/modelinference). In this example we use a `Mistral-Large` deployment. 

    * You can follow the instructions at [Deploy models as serverless APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/deploy-models-serverless).

Alternatively, you can use GitHub Models endpoints with this integration, including the free tier experience. Read more about [GitHub models](https://github.com/marketplace/models).

## Environment Setup

Follow this steps to get the information you need from the model you want to use:

1. Go to the [Azure AI Foundry (formerly Azure AI Studio)](https://ai.azure.com/) or [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com), depending on the product you are using.
2. Go to deployments (endpoints in Azure Machine Learning) and select the model you have deployed as indicated in the prerequisites.
3. Copy the endpoint URL and the key.
    
> If your model was deployed with Microsoft Entra ID support, you don't need a key.

In this scenario, we have placed both the endpoint URL and key in the following environment variables:

## Connect to your deployment and endpoint

To use LLMs deployed in Azure AI studio or Azure Machine Learning you need the endpoint and credentials to connect to it. The parameter `model_name` is not required for endpoints serving a single model, like Managed Online Endpoints.
