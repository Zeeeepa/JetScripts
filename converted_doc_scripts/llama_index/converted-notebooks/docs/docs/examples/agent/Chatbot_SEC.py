# How to Build a Chatbot

LlamaIndex serves as a bridge between your data and Language Learning Models (LLMs), providing a toolkit that enables you to establish a query interface around your data for a variety of tasks, such as question-answering and summarization.

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through building a context-augmented chatbot using a [Data Agent](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/stable/core_modules/agent_modules/agents/root.html). This agent, powered by LLMs, is capable of intelligently executing tasks over your data. The end result is a chatbot agent equipped with a robust set of data interface tools provided by LlamaIndex to answer queries about your data.

**Note**: This tutorial builds upon initial work on creating a query interface over SEC 10-K filings - [check it out here](https://medium.com/@jerryjliu98/how-unstructured-and-llamaindex-can-help-bring-the-power-of-llms-to-your-own-data-3657d063e30d).

### Context

In this guide, weâ€™ll build a "10-K Chatbot" that uses raw UBER 10-K HTML filings from Dropbox. Users can interact with the chatbot to ask questions related to the 10-K filings.

### Setting up a Sub Question Query Engine to Synthesize Answers Across 10-K Filings

Since we have access to documents of 4 years, we may not only want to ask questions regarding the 10-K document of a given year, but ask questions that require analysis over all 10-K filings.

To address this, we can use a [Sub Question Query Engine](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/query_engine/sub_question_query_engine.html). It decomposes a query into subqueries, each answered by an individual vector index, and synthesizes the results to answer the overall query.

LlamaIndex provides some wrappers around indices (and query engines) so that they can be used by query engines and agents. First we define a `QueryEngineTool` for each vector index.
Each tool has a name and a description; these are what the LLM agent sees to decide which tool to choose.
