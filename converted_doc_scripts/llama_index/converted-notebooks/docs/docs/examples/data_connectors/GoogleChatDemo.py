# Google Chat Reader Test

Demonstrates our Google Chat data connector.

If you're opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™.

"""
This loader takes in IDs of Google Chat spaces or messages and parses the chat history into `Document`s. The space/message ID can be found in the URL, as shown below:

- mail.google.com/chat/u/0/#chat/space/**<CHAT_ID>**

Before using this loader, you need to create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project with a Google Workspace account. Then, you need to authorize the app with user credentials. Follow the prerequisites and steps 1 and 2 of [this guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize-chat-user). After downloading the client secret JSON file, rename it as **`credentials.json`** and save it into your project folder.

This example parses a chat between two users. They first discuss math homework, then they plan a trip to San Francisco in a thread. At the end, they discuss finishing an essay. See the full thread [here](https://pastebin.com/FrYscMAa).

## Basic Usage

The example below loads the entire chat history into a `SummaryIndex`.
"""
logger.info("## Basic Usage")


space_ids = [
    "AAAAtTPwdzg"
]  # The Google account you authenticated with must have access to this space
reader = GoogleChatReader()
docs = reader.load_data(space_names=space_ids)

index = SummaryIndex.from_documents(docs)

query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
response = query_engine.query("What was the overall conversation about?")


display(Markdown(f"{response}"))

"""
## Filtering and Ordering

### Ordering
You can order the chat history by ascending or descending order.
"""
logger.info("## Filtering and Ordering")

docs = reader.load_data(space_names=space_ids, order_asc=False)

index = SummaryIndex.from_documents(docs)

    "List the things that the users discussed in the order they were discussed in. Make the list short."
)
display(Markdown(f"{response}"))

"""
Even though the messages were retrieved in reverse order, the list is still in the correct order because messages have a timestamp in their metadata.

### Message Limiting
Messages can be limited to a certain number using the `num_messages` parameter. However, the number of messages that are loaded may not be exactly this number. If `order_asc` is True, then takes the first `num_messages` messages within the given time frame. If `order_desc` is True, then takes the last `num_messages` messages within the time frame.
