# Plan-and-Execute

This notebook shows how to create a "plan-and-execute" style agent. This is heavily inspired by the [Plan-and-Solve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04091) paper as well as the [Baby-AGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) project.

The core idea is to first come up with a multi-step plan, and then go through that plan one item at a time.
After accomplishing a particular task, you can then revisit the plan and modify as appropriate.


The general computational graph looks like the following:

![plan-and-execute diagram](attachment:86cf6404-3d9b-41cb-ab97-5e451f576620.png)


This compares to a typical [ReAct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) style agent where you think one step at a time.
The advantages of this "plan-and-execute" style agent are:

1. Explicit long term planning (which even really strong LLMs can struggle with)
2. Ability to use smaller/weaker models for the execution step, only using larger/better models for the planning step


The following walkthrough demonstrates how to do so in LangGraph. The resulting agent will leave a trace like the following example: ([link](https://smith.langchain.com/public/d46e24d3-dda6-44d5-9550-b618fca4e0d4/r)).

## Setup

First, we need to install the packages required.
"""
logger.info("# Plan-and-Execute")

# %%capture --no-stderr
# %pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain-community langchain-ollama tavily-python

"""
Next, we need to set API keys for Ollama(the LLM we will use) and Tavily (the search tool we will use)

## Define Tools

We will first define the tools we want to use. For this simple example, we will use a built-in search tool via Tavily. However, it is really easy to create your own tools - see documentation [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/custom_tools) on how to do that.

## Define our Execution Agent

Now we will create the execution agent we want to use to execute tasks. 
Note that for this example, we will be using the same execution agent for each task, but this doesn't HAVE to be the case.

    {"messages": [("user", "who is the winnner of the us open")]})

"""
## Define the State

Let's now start by defining the state the track for this agent.

First, we will need to track the current plan. Let's represent that as a list of strings.

Next, we should track previously executed steps. Let's represent that as a list of tuples (these tuples will contain the step and then the result)

Finally, we need to have some state to represent the final response as well as the original input.

"""
## Conclusion

Congrats on making a plan-and-execute agent! One known limitations of the above design is that each task is still executed in sequence, meaning embarrassingly parallel operations all add to the total execution time. You could improve on this by having each task represented as a DAG (similar to LLMCompiler), rather than a regular list.
