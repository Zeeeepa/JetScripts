# Human-in-the-loop

!!! tip "This guide uses the new `interrupt` function."

    As of LangGraph 0.2.57, the recommended way to set breakpoints is using the [`interrupt` function][langgraph.types.interrupt] as it simplifies **human-in-the-loop** patterns.

    If you're looking for the previous version of this conceptual guide, which relied on static breakpoints and `NodeInterrupt` exception, it is available [here](v0-human-in-the-loop.md). 

A **human-in-the-loop** (or "on-the-loop") workflow integrates human input into automated processes, allowing for decisions, validation, or corrections at key stages. This is especially useful in **LLM-based applications**, where the underlying model may generate occasional inaccuracies. In low-error-tolerance scenarios like compliance, decision-making, or content generation, human involvement ensures reliability by enabling review, correction, or override of model outputs.


## Use cases

Key use cases for **human-in-the-loop** workflows in LLM-based applications include:

1. [**üõ†Ô∏è Reviewing tool calls**](#review-tool-calls): Humans can review, edit, or approve tool calls requested by the LLM before tool execution.
2. **‚úÖ Validating LLM outputs**: Humans can review, edit, or approve content generated by the LLM.
3. **üí° Providing context**: Enable the LLM to explicitly request human input for clarification or additional details or to support multi-turn conversations.

## `interrupt`

The [`interrupt` function][langgraph.types.interrupt] in LangGraph enables human-in-the-loop workflows by pausing the graph at a specific node, presenting information to a human, and resuming the graph with their input. This function is useful for tasks like approvals, edits, or collecting additional input. The [`interrupt` function][langgraph.types.interrupt] is used in conjunction with the [`Command`](../reference/types.md#langgraph.types.Command) object to resume the graph with a value provided by the human.

      Interrupts are both powerful and ergonomic. However, while they may resemble Python's input() function in terms of developer experience, it's important to note that they do not automatically resume execution from the interruption point. Instead, they rerun the entire node where the interrupt was used.
      For this reason, interrupts are typically best placed at the start of a node or in a dedicated node. Please read the [resuming from an interrupt](#how-does-resuming-from-an-interrupt-work) section for more details.

      ```

## Requirements

To use `interrupt` in your graph, you need to:

1. [**Specify a checkpointer**](persistence.md#checkpoints) to save the graph state after each step.
2. **Call `interrupt()`** in the appropriate place. See the [Design Patterns](#design-patterns) section for examples.
3. **Run the graph** with a [**thread ID**](./persistence.md#threads) until the `interrupt` is hit.
4. **Resume execution** using `invoke`/`ainvoke`/`stream`/`astream` (see [**The `Command` primitive**](#the-command-primitive)).

## Design Patterns

There are typically three different **actions** that you can do with a human-in-the-loop workflow:

1. **Approve or Reject**: Pause the graph before a critical step, such as an API call, to review and approve the action. If the action is rejected, you can prevent the graph from executing the step, and potentially take an alternative action. This pattern often involve **routing** the graph based on the human's input.
2. **Edit Graph State**: Pause the graph to review and edit the graph state. This is useful for correcting mistakes or updating the state with additional information. This pattern often involves **updating** the state with the human's input.
3. **Get Input**: Explicitly request human input at a particular step in the graph. This is useful for collecting additional information or context to inform the agent's decision-making process or for supporting **multi-turn conversations**.

Below we show different design patterns that can be implemented using these **actions**.

### Multi-turn conversation

<figure markdown="1">
![image](img/human_in_the_loop/multi-turn-conversation.png){: style="max-height:400px"}
<figcaption>A <strong>multi-turn conversation</strong> architecture where an <strong>agent</strong> and <strong>human node</strong> cycle back and forth until the agent decides to hand off the conversation to another agent or another part of the system.
</figcaption>
</figure>

A **multi-turn conversation** involves multiple back-and-forth interactions between an agent and a human, which can allow the agent to gather additional information from the human in a conversational manner.

This design pattern is useful in an LLM application consisting of [multiple agents](./multi_agent.md). One or more agents may need to carry out multi-turn conversations with a human, where the human provides input or feedback at different stages of the conversation. For simplicity, the agent implementation below is illustrated as a single node, but in reality 
it may be part of a larger graph consisting of multiple nodes and include a conditional edge.

=== "Using a human node per agent"

    In this pattern, each agent has its own human node for collecting user input. 
    This can be achieved by either naming the human nodes with unique names (e.g., "human for agent 1", "human for agent 2") or by
    using subgraphs where a subgraph contains a human node and an agent node.

    ```python

    def human_input(state: State):
        human_message = interrupt("human_input")
        return {
            "messages": [
                {
                    "role": "human",
                    "content": human_message
                }
            ]
        }

    def agent(state: State):
        # Agent logic
        ...

    graph_builder.add_node("human_input", human_input)
    graph_builder.add_edge("human_input", "agent")
    graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

    # After running the graph and hitting the interrupt, the graph will pause.
    # Resume it with the human's input.
    graph.invoke(
        Command(resume="hello!"),
        config=thread_config
    )
    ```


=== "Sharing human node across multiple agents"

    In this pattern, a single human node is used to collect user input for multiple agents. The active agent is determined from the state, so after human input is collected, the graph can route to the correct agent.

    ```python

    def human_node(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["agent_1", "agent_2", ...]]:
        """
logger.info("### Multi-turn conversation")A node for collecting user input."""
        user_input = interrupt(value="Ready for user input.")

        # Determine the **active agent** from the state, so 
        # we can route to the correct agent after collecting input.
        # For example, add a field to the state or use the last active agent.
        # or fill in `name` attribute of AI messages generated by the agents.
        active_agent = ... 

        return Command(
            update={
                "messages": [{
                    "role": "human",
                    "content": user_input,
                }]
            },
            goto=active_agent,
        )
    ```

See [how to implement multi-turn conversations](../how-tos/multi-agent-multi-turn-convo.ipynb) for a more detailed example.

### Validating human input

If you need to validate the input provided by the human within the graph itself (rather than on the client side), you can achieve this by using multiple interrupt calls within a single node.

    question = "What is your age?"

    logger.debug(f"The human in the loop is {answer} years old.")
    return {
        "age": answer
    }

"""
## The `Command` primitive

When using the `interrupt` function, the graph will pause at the interrupt and wait for user input.

Graph execution can be resumed using the [Command](../reference/types.md#langgraph.types.Command) primitive which can be passed through the `invoke`, `ainvoke`, `stream` or `astream` methods.

The `Command` primitive provides several options to control and modify the graph's state during resumption:

1. **Pass a value to the `interrupt`**: Provide data, such as a user's response, to the graph using `Command(resume=value)`. Execution resumes from the beginning of the node where the `interrupt` was used, however, this time the `interrupt(...)` call will return the value passed in the `Command(resume=value)` instead of pausing the graph.

       ```python
       # Resume graph execution with the user's input.
       graph.invoke(Command(resume={"age": "25"}), thread_config)
       ```

2. **Update the graph state**: Modify the graph state using `Command(update=update)`. Note that resumption starts from the beginning of the node where the `interrupt` was used. Execution resumes from the beginning of the node where the `interrupt` was used, but with the updated state.

      ```python
      # Update the graph state and resume.
      # You must provide a `resume` value if using an `interrupt`.
      graph.invoke(Command(update={"foo": "bar"}, resume="Let's go!!!"), thread_config)
      ```

By leveraging `Command`, you can resume graph execution, handle user inputs, and dynamically adjust the graph's state.

## Using with `invoke` and `ainvoke`

When you use `stream` or `astream` to run the graph, you will receive an `Interrupt` event that let you know the `interrupt` was triggered. 

`invoke` and `ainvoke` do not return the interrupt information. To access this information, you must use the [get_state](../reference/graphs.md#langgraph.graph.graph.CompiledGraph.get_state) method to retrieve the graph state after calling `invoke` or `ainvoke`.

## How does resuming from an interrupt work?

!!! warning

    Resuming from an `interrupt` is **different** from Python's `input()` function, where execution resumes from the exact point where the `input()` function was called.

A critical aspect of using `interrupt` is understanding how resuming works. When you resume execution after an `interrupt`, graph execution starts from the **beginning** of the **graph node** where the last `interrupt` was triggered.

## Common Pitfalls

### Side-effects

Place code with side effects, such as API calls, **after** the `interrupt` to avoid duplication, as these are re-triggered every time the node is resumed. 

=== "Side effects before interrupt (BAD)"

    This code will re-execute the API call another time when the node is resumed from
    the `interrupt`.

    This can be problematic if the API call is not idempotent or is just expensive.

logger.info("## Common Pitfalls")Human node with validation."""
        api_call(...) # This code will be re-executed when the node is resumed.

=== "Side effects in a separate node (OK)"

### Subgraphs called as functions

When invoking a subgraph [as a function](low_level.md#as-a-function), the **parent graph** will resume execution from the **beginning of the node** where the subgraph was invoked (and where an `interrupt` was triggered). Similarly, the **subgraph**, will resume from the **beginning of the node** where the `interrupt()` function was called.

For example,
"""
logger.info("### Subgraphs called as functions")

def node_in_parent_graph(state: State):
    some_code()  # <-- This will re-execute when the subgraph is resumed.
    subgraph_result = subgraph.invoke(some_input)
    ...

"""
??? "**Example: Parent and Subgraph Execution Flow**"

      Say we have a parent graph with 3 nodes:

      **Parent Graph**: `node_1` ‚Üí `node_2` (subgraph call) ‚Üí `node_3`

      And the subgraph has 3 nodes, where the second node contains an `interrupt`:

      **Subgraph**: `sub_node_1` ‚Üí `sub_node_2` (`interrupt`) ‚Üí `sub_node_3`

      When resuming the graph, the execution will proceed as follows:

      1. **Skip `node_1`** in the parent graph (already executed, graph state was saved in snapshot).
      2. **Re-execute `node_2`** in the parent graph from the start.
      3. **Skip `sub_node_1`** in the subgraph (already executed, graph state was saved in snapshot).
      4. **Re-execute `sub_node_2`** in the subgraph from the beginning.
      5. Continue with `sub_node_3` and subsequent nodes.

### Using multiple interrupts

Using multiple interrupts within a **single** node can be helpful for patterns like [validating human input](#validating-human-input). However, using multiple interrupts in the same node can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.

When a node contains multiple interrupt calls, LangGraph keeps a list of resume values specific to the task executing the node. Whenever execution resumes, it starts at the beginning of the node. For each interrupt encountered, LangGraph checks if a matching value exists in the task's resume list. Matching is **strictly index-based**, so the order of interrupt calls within the node is critical.

To avoid issues, refrain from dynamically changing the node's structure between executions. This includes adding, removing, or reordering interrupt calls, as such changes can result in mismatched indices. These problems often arise from unconventional patterns, such as mutating state via `Command(resume=..., update=SOME_STATE_MUTATION)` or relying on global variables to modify the node‚Äôs structure dynamically.
