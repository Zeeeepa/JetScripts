title: 'ðŸ“ƒ JSON'
---

To add any json file, use the data_type as `json`. Headers are included for each line, so for example if you have a json like `{"age": 18}`, then it will be added as `age: 18`.

Here are the supported sources for loading `json`:

1. URL - valid url to json file that ends with ".json" extension.
2. Local file - valid url to local json file that ends with ".json" extension.
3. String - valid json string (e.g. - app.add('{"foo": "bar"}'))

<Tip>
If you would like to add other data structures (e.g. list, dict etc.), convert it to a valid json first using `json.dumps()` function.
</Tip>
