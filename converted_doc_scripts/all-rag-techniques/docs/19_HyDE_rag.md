# Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE) for RAG

In this notebook, I implement HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embedding) - an innovative retrieval technique that transforms user queries into hypothetical answer documents before performing retrieval. This approach bridges the semantic gap between short queries and lengthy documents.

Traditional RAG systems embed the user's short query directly, but this often fails to capture the semantic richness needed for optimal retrieval. HyDE solves this by:

- Generating a hypothetical document that answers the query
- Embedding this expanded document instead of the original query
- Retrieving documents similar to this hypothetical document
- Creating more contextually relevant answers

## Setting Up the Environment
We begin by importing necessary libraries.

```python
import os
import numpy as np
import json
import fitz
from openai import OpenAI
import re
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Setting Up the OpenAI API Client
We initialize the OpenAI client to generate embeddings and responses.

```python
# Initialize the OpenAI client with the base URL and API key
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.studio.nebius.com/v1/",
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")  # Retrieve the API key from environment variables
)
```

=== HyDE Response ===
The main ethical considerations in artificial intelligence development include:

1. Bias and Fairness: Ensuring that AI systems are fair, non-discriminatory, and do not perpetuate existing biases present in the data they are trained on.

2. Transparency and Explainability: Making AI decisions more understandable and assessable to build trust and accountability.

3. Privacy and Data Protection: Ensuring responsible data handling, implementing privacy-preserving techniques, and complying with data protection regulations.

4. Accountability and Responsibility: Establishing clear guidelines and frameworks for AI development and deployment to address potential harms and ensure ethical behavior.

5. Job Displacement: Addressing the potential economic and social impacts of AI-driven automation.

6. Autonomy and Control: Establishing guidelines and frameworks to ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed in a way that prioritizes human well-being and safety.

7. Weaponization of AI: Addressing the risks associated with the potential use of AI in autonomous weapons systems.

8. Respect for Human Rights: Prioritizing the respect and protection of human rights, particularly in the development and deployment of AI systems.

These considerations are guided by principles of Ethical AI, which include respect for human rights, privacy, non-discrimination, and beneficence.

=== OVERALL ANALYSIS ===
**Overall Analysis: HyDE RAG vs Standard RAG**

Based on the evaluation of Query 1, we can observe that both HyDE RAG and standard RAG provide accurate information about the impact of neural network architecture on AI performance. However, a more in-depth analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach reveals the following:

**Strengths and Weaknesses of HyDE RAG:**

Strengths:

1. **Improved contextual understanding**: HyDE RAG's use of document embedding allows it to capture the context and relationships between different concepts, leading to more accurate and informative responses.
2. **Better handling of complex queries**: HyDE RAG's ability to represent documents as vectors enables it to capture the nuances of complex queries, such as the impact of neural network architecture on AI performance.

Weaknesses:

1. **Higher computational requirements**: HyDE RAG's use of document embedding requires more computational resources, which can lead to slower response times.
2. **Overfitting to training data**: HyDE RAG's reliance on document embedding can lead to overfitting to the training data, which can result in poor performance on unseen queries.

**Strengths and Weaknesses of Standard RAG:**

Strengths:

1. **Faster response times**: Standard RAG's use of direct query embedding allows it to respond quickly, even to complex queries.
2. **Robustness to overfitting**: Standard RAG's direct query embedding approach is less prone to overfitting, as it does not rely on document representation.

Weaknesses:

1. **Limited contextual understanding**: Standard RAG's direct query embedding approach can lead to limited contextual understanding, resulting in less accurate and informative responses.
2. **Difficulty handling complex queries**: Standard RAG's direct query embedding approach can struggle to capture the nuances of complex queries, such as the impact of neural network architecture on AI performance.

**When HyDE RAG Outperforms Standard RAG:**

HyDE RAG is likely to outperform Standard RAG in the following scenarios:

1. **Complex queries**: HyDE RAG's ability to capture the nuances of complex queries, such as the impact of neural network architecture on AI performance, makes it a better choice for these types of queries.
2. **Contextual understanding**: HyDE RAG's improved contextual understanding, enabled by document embedding, makes it a better choice when the query requires a deep understanding of the context and relationships between different concepts.

**When Standard RAG Outperforms HyDE RAG:**

Standard RAG is likely to outperform HyDE RAG in the following scenarios:

1. **Simple queries**: Standard RAG's direct query embedding approach can respond quickly and accurately to simple queries, making it a better choice for these types of queries.
2. **Real-time applications**: Standard RAG's faster response times make it a better choice for real-time applications, such as search engines or chatbots.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Use HyDE RAG for complex queries**: When dealing with complex queries that require a deep understanding of the context and relationships between different concepts, HyDE RAG is a better choice.
2. **Use Standard RAG for simple queries**: When dealing with simple queries that require a quick and accurate response, Standard RAG is a better choice.
3. **Use HyDE RAG for applications requiring contextual understanding**: When the application requires a deep understanding of the context and relationships between different concepts, HyDE RAG is a better choice.
4. **Use Standard RAG for applications requiring real-time responses**: When the application requires a quick and accurate response, Standard RAG is a better choice.
