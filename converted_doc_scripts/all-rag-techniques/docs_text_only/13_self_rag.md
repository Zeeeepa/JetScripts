# Self-RAG: A Dynamic Approach to RAG

In this notebook, I implement Self-RAG, an advanced RAG system that dynamically decides when and how to use retrieved information. Unlike traditional RAG approaches, Self-RAG introduces reflection points throughout the retrieval and generation process, resulting in higher quality and more reliable responses.

## Key Components of Self-RAG

1. **Retrieval Decision**: Determines if retrieval is even necessary for a given query
2. **Document Retrieval**: Fetches potentially relevant documents when needed
3. **Relevance Evaluation**: Assesses how relevant each retrieved document is
4. **Response Generation**: Creates responses based on relevant contexts
5. **Support Assessment**: Evaluates if responses are properly grounded in the context
6. **Utility Evaluation**: Rates the overall usefulness of generated responses

## Setting Up the Environment
We begin by importing necessary libraries.

## Extracting Text from a PDF File
To implement RAG, we first need a source of textual data. In this case, we extract text from a PDF file using the PyMuPDF library.

## Chunking the Extracted Text
Once we have the extracted text, we divide it into smaller, overlapping chunks to improve retrieval accuracy.

## Setting Up the OpenAI API Client
We initialize the OpenAI client to generate embeddings and responses.

## Simple Vector Store Implementation
We'll create a basic vector store to manage document chunks and their embeddings.

## Evaluating the Self-RAG System

The final step is to evaluate the Self-RAG system against traditional RAG approaches. We'll compare the quality of responses generated by both systems and analyze the performance of Self-RAG in different scenarios.
