# Hierarchical Indices for RAG

In this notebook, I implement a hierarchical indexing approach for RAG systems. This technique improves retrieval by using a two-tier search method: first identifying relevant document sections through summaries, then retrieving specific details from those sections.

Traditional RAG approaches treat all text chunks equally, which can lead to:

- Lost context when chunks are too small
- Irrelevant results when the document collection is large
- Inefficient searches across the entire corpus

Hierarchical retrieval solves these problems by:

- Creating concise summaries for larger document sections
- First searching these summaries to identify relevant sections
- Then retrieving detailed information only from those sections
- Maintaining context while preserving specific details

## Setting Up the Environment
We begin by importing necessary libraries.

## Setting Up the OpenAI API Client
We initialize the OpenAI client to generate embeddings and responses.
