# Contextual Compression for Enhanced RAG Systems
In this notebook, I implement a contextual compression technique to improve our RAG system's efficiency. We'll filter and compress retrieved text chunks to keep only the most relevant parts, reducing noise and improving response quality.

When retrieving documents for RAG, we often get chunks containing both relevant and irrelevant information. Contextual compression helps us:

- Remove irrelevant sentences and paragraphs
- Focus only on query-relevant information
- Maximize the useful signal in our context window

Let's implement this approach from scratch!

## Setting Up the Environment
We begin by importing necessary libraries.

## Extracting Text from a PDF File
To implement RAG, we first need a source of textual data. In this case, we extract text from a PDF file using the PyMuPDF library.

## Chunking the Extracted Text
Once we have the extracted text, we divide it into smaller, overlapping chunks to improve retrieval accuracy.

## Setting Up the OpenAI API Client
We initialize the OpenAI client to generate embeddings and responses.

## Building a Simple Vector Store
let's implement a simple vector store since we cannot use FAISS.

## Embedding Generation

## Building Our Document Processing Pipeline

## Implementing Contextual Compression
This is the core of our approach - we'll use an LLM to filter and compress retrieved content.

## Implementing Batch Compression
For efficiency, we'll compress multiple chunks in one go when possible.

## Comparing RAG With and Without Compression
Let's create a function to compare standard RAG with our compression-enhanced version:


## Evaluating Our Approach
Now, let's implement a function to evaluate and compare the responses:
