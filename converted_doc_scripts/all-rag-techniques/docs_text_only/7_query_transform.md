# Query Transformations for Enhanced RAG Systems

This notebook implements three query transformation techniques to enhance retrieval performance in RAG systems without relying on specialized libraries like LangChain. By modifying user queries, we can significantly improve the relevance and comprehensiveness of retrieved information.

## Key Transformation Techniques

1. **Query Rewriting**: Makes queries more specific and detailed for better search precision.
2. **Step-back Prompting**: Generates broader queries to retrieve useful contextual information.
3. **Sub-query Decomposition**: Breaks complex queries into simpler components for comprehensive retrieval.

## Setting Up the Environment
We begin by importing necessary libraries.

## Setting Up the OpenAI API Client
We initialize the OpenAI client to generate embeddings and responses.

## Implementing Query Transformation Techniques
### 1. Query Rewriting
This technique makes queries more specific and detailed to improve precision in retrieval.

### 2. Step-back Prompting
This technique generates broader queries to retrieve contextual background information.

### 3. Sub-query Decomposition
This technique breaks down complex queries into simpler components for comprehensive retrieval.

## Demonstrating Query Transformation Techniques
Let's apply these techniques to an example query.

## Building a Simple Vector Store
To demonstrate how query transformations integrate with retrieval, let's implement a simple vector store.
