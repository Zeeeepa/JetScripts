# Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE) for RAG

In this notebook, I implement HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embedding) - an innovative retrieval technique that transforms user queries into hypothetical answer documents before performing retrieval. This approach bridges the semantic gap between short queries and lengthy documents.

Traditional RAG systems embed the user's short query directly, but this often fails to capture the semantic richness needed for optimal retrieval. HyDE solves this by:

- Generating a hypothetical document that answers the query
- Embedding this expanded document instead of the original query
- Retrieving documents similar to this hypothetical document
- Creating more contextually relevant answers

## Setting Up the Environment
We begin by importing necessary libraries.

## Setting Up the OpenAI API Client
We initialize the OpenAI client to generate embeddings and responses.
