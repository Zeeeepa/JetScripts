# Graph RAG: Graph-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation

In this notebook, I implement Graph RAG - a technique that enhances traditional RAG systems by organizing knowledge as a connected graph rather than a flat collection of documents. This allows the system to navigate related concepts and retrieve more contextually relevant information than standard vector similarity approaches.

Key Benefits of Graph RAG

- Preserves relationships between pieces of information
- Enables traversal through connected concepts to find relevant context
- Improves handling of complex, multi-part queries
- Provides better explainability through visualized knowledge paths

## Setting Up the Environment
We begin by importing necessary libraries.

## Setting Up the OpenAI API Client
We initialize the OpenAI client to generate embeddings and responses.
