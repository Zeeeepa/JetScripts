# Reranking for Enhanced RAG Systems

This notebook implements reranking techniques to improve retrieval quality in RAG systems. Reranking acts as a second filtering step after initial retrieval to ensure the most relevant content is used for response generation.

## Key Concepts of Reranking

1. **Initial Retrieval**: First pass using basic similarity search (less accurate but faster)
2. **Document Scoring**: Evaluating each retrieved document's relevance to the query
3. **Reordering**: Sorting documents by their relevance scores
4. **Selection**: Using only the most relevant documents for response generation

## Setting Up the Environment
We begin by importing necessary libraries.

## Extracting Text from a PDF File
To implement RAG, we first need a source of textual data. In this case, we extract text from a PDF file using the PyMuPDF library.

## Chunking the Extracted Text
Once we have the extracted text, we divide it into smaller, overlapping chunks to improve retrieval accuracy.

## Setting Up the OpenAI API Client
We initialize the OpenAI client to generate embeddings and responses.

## Building a Simple Vector Store
To demonstrate how reranking integrate with retrieval, let's implement a simple vector store.

## Creating Embeddings

## Document Processing Pipeline
Now that we have defined the necessary functions and classes, we can proceed to define the document processing pipeline.

## Implementing LLM-based Reranking
Let's implement the LLM-based reranking function using the OpenAI API.

## Simple Keyword-based Reranking

## Response Generation

## Full RAG Pipeline with Reranking
So far, we have implemented the core components of the RAG pipeline, including document processing, question answering, and reranking. Now, we will combine these components to create a full RAG pipeline.

## Evaluating Reranking Quality
