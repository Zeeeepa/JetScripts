# Contextual Chunk Headers (CCH) in Simple RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves the factual accuracy of language models by retrieving relevant external knowledge before generating a response. However, standard chunking often loses important context, making retrieval less effective.

Contextual Chunk Headers (CCH) enhance RAG by prepending high-level context (like document titles or section headers) to each chunk before embedding them. This improves retrieval quality and prevents out-of-context responses.

## Steps in this Notebook:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Load and preprocess the text data.
2. **Chunking with Contextual Headers**: Extract section titles and prepend them to chunks.
3. **Embedding Creation**: Convert context-enhanced chunks into numerical representations.
4. **Semantic Search**: Retrieve relevant chunks based on a user query.
5. **Response Generation**: Use a language model to generate a response from retrieved text.
6. **Evaluation**: Assess response accuracy using a scoring system.

## Setting Up the Environment
We begin by importing necessary libraries.

## Extracting Text and Identifying Section Headers
We extract text from a PDF while also identifying section titles (potential headers for chunks).

## Setting Up the OpenAI API Client
We initialize the OpenAI client to generate embeddings and responses.

## Chunking Text with Contextual Headers
To improve retrieval, we generate descriptive headers for each chunk using an LLM model.

## Extracting and Chunking Text from a PDF File
Now, we load the PDF, extract text, and split it into chunks.

## Creating Embeddings for Headers and Text
We create embeddings for both headers and text to improve retrieval accuracy.

## Performing Semantic Search
We implement cosine similarity to find the most relevant text chunks for a user query.

## Running a Query on Extracted Chunks

## Generating a Response Based on Retrieved Chunks

## Evaluating the AI Response
We compare the AI response with the expected answer and assign a score.
