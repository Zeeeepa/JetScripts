# Relevant Segment Extraction (RSE) for Enhanced RAG

In this notebook, we implement a Relevant Segment Extraction (RSE) technique to improve the context quality in our RAG system. Rather than simply retrieving a collection of isolated chunks, we identify and reconstruct continuous segments of text that provide better context to our language model.

## Key Concept

Relevant chunks tend to be clustered together within documents. By identifying these clusters and preserving their continuity, we provide more coherent context for the LLM to work with.

## Setting Up the Environment
We begin by importing necessary libraries.

## Extracting Text from a PDF File
To implement RAG, we first need a source of textual data. In this case, we extract text from a PDF file using the PyMuPDF library.

## Chunking the Extracted Text
Once we have the extracted text, we divide it into smaller, overlapping chunks to improve retrieval accuracy.

## Setting Up the OpenAI API Client
We initialize the OpenAI client to generate embeddings and responses.

## Building a Simple Vector Store
let's implement a simple vector store.

## Creating Embeddings for Text Chunks
Embeddings transform text into numerical vectors, which allow for efficient similarity search.

## Processing Documents with RSE
Now let's implement the core RSE functionality.

## RSE Core Algorithm: Computing Chunk Values and Finding Best Segments
Now that we have the necessary functions to process a document and generate embeddings for its chunks, we can implement the core algorithm for RSE.

## Comparing with Standard Retrieval
Let's implement a standard retrieval approach to compare with RSE:
