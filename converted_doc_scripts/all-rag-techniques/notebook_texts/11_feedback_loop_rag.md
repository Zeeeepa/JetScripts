# Feedback Loop in RAG

In this notebook, I implement a RAG system with a feedback loop mechanism that continuously improves over time. By collecting and incorporating user feedback, our system learns to provide more relevant and higher-quality responses with each interaction.

Traditional RAG systems are static - they retrieve information based solely on embedding similarity. With a feedback loop, we create a dynamic system that:

- Remembers what worked (and what didn't)
- Adjusts document relevance scores over time
- Incorporates successful Q&A pairs into its knowledge base
- Gets smarter with each user interaction

## Setting Up the Environment
We begin by importing necessary libraries.

## Extracting Text from a PDF File
To implement RAG, we first need a source of textual data. In this case, we extract text from a PDF file using the PyMuPDF library.

## Chunking the Extracted Text
Once we have the extracted text, we divide it into smaller, overlapping chunks to improve retrieval accuracy.

## Setting Up the OpenAI API Client
We initialize the OpenAI client to generate embeddings and responses.

## Simple Vector Store Implementation
We'll create a basic vector store to manage document chunks and their embeddings.

## Creating Embeddings

## Feedback System Functions
Now we'll implement the core feedback system components.
