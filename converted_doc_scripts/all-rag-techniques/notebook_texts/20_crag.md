# Corrective RAG (CRAG) Implementation

In this notebook, I implement Corrective RAG - an advanced approach that dynamically evaluates retrieved information and corrects the retrieval process when necessary, using web search as a fallback.

CRAG improves on traditional RAG by:

- Evaluating retrieved content before using it
- Dynamically switching between knowledge sources based on relevance
- Correcting the retrieval with web search when local knowledge is insufficient
- Combining information from multiple sources when appropriate

## Setting Up the Environment
We begin by importing necessary libraries.

## Setting Up the OpenAI API Client
We initialize the OpenAI client to generate embeddings and responses.
