# Redis Use Cases

Here are real-world use cases for each Redis strategy, along with the problems they solve, sample user flow, and acceptance criteria:

---

### **1. Caching**

**Use Case:** E-commerce product details caching.  
**Problem Solved:** Reduces database load and speeds up response times for frequently accessed data like product pages.

**Scenario User Flow:**

1. User searches for a product.
2. Application checks Redis cache for product details.
3. If found, returns cached data; otherwise, fetches data from the database, caches it, and returns to the user.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Cache hit returns data within 10ms.
- Cache miss fetches data from the database and stores it in Redis within 500ms.
- Cached data expires after 1 hour.

### **2. Session Management**

**Use Case:** Web app user sessions (e.g., social media platform).  
**Problem Solved:** Ensures fast and scalable session handling across distributed systems.

**Scenario User Flow:**

1. User logs in and a session ID is generated.
2. Session data (e.g., user ID) is stored in Redis with a timeout.
3. On subsequent requests, session ID is used to fetch user data from Redis.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Session is valid and retrievable within 30 minutes of inactivity.
- Invalid session returns an error within 100ms.

### **3. Publish/Subscribe Messaging**

**Use Case:** Real-time notifications in a messaging app.  
**Problem Solved:** Broadcasts updates (e.g., new messages) to all subscribers in real-time.

**Scenario User Flow:**

1. User sends a message to a group.
2. Redis publishes the message to the group's channel.
3. All group members receive the message in real-time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Messages are delivered to all subscribers within 50ms of being published.
- Subscribers receive messages only from their subscribed channels.

---

### **4. Rate Limiting**

**Use Case:** API rate limiting for public APIs.  
**Problem Solved:** Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests per user.

**Scenario User Flow:**

1. User sends an API request.
2. Redis increments the userâ€™s request count.
3. If the count exceeds the allowed threshold, the request is blocked.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Users can send up to 100 requests per minute.
- Requests exceeding the limit are blocked with a response time <200ms.

### **5. Leaderboards and Counting**

**Use Case:** Gaming app global leaderboards.  
**Problem Solved:** Efficiently ranks players based on scores.

**Scenario User Flow:**

1. A player completes a game and updates their score.
2. Redis stores and updates the player's score in a sorted set.
3. Users view the top 10 players.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Scores are updated in Redis within 50ms.
- Leaderboard retrieval takes <100ms.

---

### **6. Geospatial Indexing**

**Use Case:** Ride-sharing app nearby drivers.  
**Problem Solved:** Finds and ranks locations based on proximity.

**Scenario User Flow:**

1. User requests a ride.
2. Redis retrieves drivers within a 5 km radius from the user's location.
3. Drivers are ranked by distance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Retrieval of nearby drivers completes within 100ms.
- Distance calculations are accurate within a 1% margin.

---

### **7. Real-Time Analytics**

**Use Case:** Website traffic analytics.  
**Problem Solved:** Tracks high-velocity data (e.g., page views) in real-time.

**Scenario User Flow:**

1. User visits a webpage.
2. Redis increments the page view counter.
3. Admin views real-time analytics for the site.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Page views are updated within 10ms of the request.
- Admin dashboard reflects real-time data within 1 second.

---

### **8. Distributed Locking**

**Use Case:** Inventory management in an e-commerce app.  
**Problem Solved:** Prevents overselling during concurrent order placements.

**Scenario User Flow:**

1. User attempts to purchase an item.
2. Redis lock is acquired to update inventory.
3. If successful, inventory is decremented and lock is released.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Lock acquisition and release occur within 100ms.
- Only one process modifies inventory for a given item at a time.

---

### **9. Message Queue**

**Use Case:** Background task processing (e.g., email sending).  
**Problem Solved:** Manages asynchronous task queues.

**Scenario User Flow:**

1. User triggers an email send.
2. Task is added to a Redis queue.
3. Worker processes the queue and sends the email.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Tasks are added to the queue within 10ms.
- Worker processes tasks sequentially within 1 second.

---

### **10. Time-Series Data**

**Use Case:** IoT sensor data collection.  
**Problem Solved:** Stores and queries time-stamped sensor readings efficiently.

**Scenario User Flow:**

1. IoT device sends temperature readings every minute.
2. Redis stores readings with timestamps in a sorted set.
3. User queries data for a specific time range.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Readings are stored within 10ms of receipt.
- Query results for a 1-hour range return within 200ms.

These examples illustrate the versatility of Redis in solving diverse application challenges with specific user flows and measurable criteria.
