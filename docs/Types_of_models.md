# Types of models

Large Language Models (LLMs) are versatile and can perform a wide range of tasks. These tasks can be broadly classified into the following categories:

---

### **1. Text Understanding Tasks**

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of a given text.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identify and classify entities (e.g., names, dates, locations) in text.
- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:** Assign grammatical categories (noun, verb, etc.) to each word.
- **Question Answering (QA):** Answer questions based on a provided context or knowledge base.
- **Text Classification:** Categorize text into predefined classes (e.g., spam detection, topic labeling).

---

### **2. Text Generation Tasks**

- **Text Completion:** Generate a continuation for an incomplete text (e.g., autocompletion).
- **Story or Article Generation:** Create coherent and contextually relevant long-form content.
- **Summarization:** Condense text into shorter versions while retaining key points (extractive or abstractive).
- **Dialogue Generation:** Generate responses in conversational settings (e.g., chatbots, virtual assistants).

---

### **3. Text Transformation Tasks**

- **Translation:** Convert text from one language to another.
- **Paraphrasing:** Rephrase text while preserving its meaning.
- **Style Transfer:** Alter the style of text (e.g., formal to casual).
- **Text Simplification:** Simplify complex text for better readability.

---

### **4. Knowledge Extraction Tasks**

- **Information Retrieval:** Extract relevant information from large datasets or documents.
- **Relation Extraction:** Identify and classify relationships between entities in text.
- **Semantic Search:** Retrieve information based on meaning rather than exact keywords.

---

### **5. Reasoning and Planning Tasks**

- **Logical Reasoning:** Solve problems requiring logic and deduction.
- **Mathematical Reasoning:** Perform calculations or solve math problems.
- **Code Generation and Debugging:** Generate or fix code based on natural language prompts.
- **Step-by-Step Problem Solving:** Break down complex problems into manageable steps.

---

### **6. Multi-modal Tasks** (if LLM is paired with visual or audio models)

- **Image Captioning:** Generate descriptive captions for images.
- **Audio Transcription:** Convert spoken language to text.
- **Video-to-Text:** Summarize or describe video content.

---

### **7. Domain-Specific Tasks**

- **Legal Document Analysis:** Extract clauses, terms, and obligations.
- **Medical Record Interpretation:** Analyze clinical notes for diagnosis or treatment suggestions.
- **Financial Report Summarization:** Condense financial documents for decision-making.

---

### **SpanMarker's Role:**

SpanMarker is particularly suited for **knowledge extraction tasks** like NER and Relation Extraction, where identifying and classifying specific spans of text is crucial.
