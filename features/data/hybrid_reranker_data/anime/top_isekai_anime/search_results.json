Reincarnated as the Daughter of the Legendary Hero and the Queen of Spirits follows a former scientist who starts a new life as the daughter of a hero and a spirit, giving her unique powers that allow her to manipulate an object's elements. The premise is fine enough, but the story's main selling point is its core family, as all three characters are main players rather than just the daughter. ",

Here are four things it may do differently from the Manhwa.\nPosts 2\nA ruthless king dies alone, only to be reborn in a fantasy world with magic. More importantly, he is born into a loving family, something he never experienced in his past life. As he spends more time in his new life, Arthur's mentality gradually morphs, and he learns to appreciate the simpler things. Story-wise, The Beginning After the End anime is not a patch on the source material, although Arthur is still a fascinating protagonist . The lackluster animation and fast pacing are far bigger issues. ",
