 The provided document contains a Python function called `call_ollama_chat` which is used to interact with an LLM (Language Model) named Ollama. This function takes in a prompt and various options such as model, system message, tools, format, options, stream, keep alive, template, and track. The function logs some information about the model, prompt, and options before making a request to the Ollama API. If the response is streamed, it returns a generator that yields each chunk of the response. If not, it returns the entire response as a single JSON object. The document also contains a helper function `convert_tool_outputs_to_string` which converts tool outputs in the messages to strings if they are not already strings. Finally, there is a main function demonstrating usage of the `call_ollama_chat` function with a sample prompt.
